Step-1  Use a hashmap and store the elements as <key, value> pairs. (Can also use frequency array based on the size of nums).

Here the key will be the element of the array and the value will be the number of times it occurs. 

Step-2  Traverse the whole array and update the occurrence of each element. 

Step-3  After that, check the map if the value for any element is greater than the floor of N/3.

            --If yes, include it in the list. 
            --Else iterate forward.

Step-4  Finally, return the list.

Dry Run: 

Letâ€™s take the example of arr[] = {10,20,40,40,40}, n=5.

First, we create an unordered map to store the count of each element.

Now traverse through the array 

--Found 10 at index 0, increase the value of key 10 in the map by 1.

--Found 20 at index 1, increase the value of key 20 in the map by 1.

--Found 40 at index 2, increase the value of key 40 in the map by 1.

--Found 40 at index 3, increase the value of key 40 in the map by 1.

--Found 40 at index 4, increase the value of key 40 in the map by 1.
